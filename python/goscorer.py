    Additionally, this could be used to enforce the Japanese rule that that stones in seki situations cannot be
    treated as dead and counted but must actually be physically captured prior to game end, by not scoring stones
    marked dead on points that belong to a seki group according to this field. However, note that it may be simpler
    to just always count marked-dead stones as points. Behaving more strictly could require careful corresponding
    UI work, since if stones that users explicitly mark to be dead are sometimes not counted as points, it may be
